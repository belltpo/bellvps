                <h2 class="mb-4">1. Scope of Policy</h2>
                <p class="text-justify">This Privacy Policy applies only to the information you provide to us online or that we collect from you while you are visiting or using our Websites or Services.

We may also record the presence of bellglobal.in software or other third party software on your computer, page views (hit counts) and other statistical and tracking information, which are aggregated with website utilization information from other users in order to understand how our Websites are being used. One or more of the above activities may also be carried out by third parties we have engaged to host certain portions or functions of or otherwise render services in connection with our Websites, such as resume submission, or operating a webcast on our behalf.</p>

                <p class="text-justify">Do Not Track (DNT) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. When a user turns on DNT, the browser sends a message to websites requesting that they don’t track the user. Standard Do Not Track technology is not yet finalized, and not all browsers support DNT. Our Websites currently do not respond to DNT signals and operate as described in this Privacy Policy whether or not a DNT signal is received.</p>
