            <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold text-center mb-8">Support Policy</h1>
            <div class="prose max-w-none text-base-content">
                <h2 class="mb-4">Support Channels</h2>
                <p class="text-justify">Email & Live Chat are the only Support Channels available for our Paid Clients Only. We are able to provide efficient and effective support to thousands of users using these support channels.</p>

                <h2 class="mb-4">Product Trials & Expectations</h2>
                <p class="text-justify">Our products are trialware. This means that users are expected to take a trial (free / paid) and subscribe only if the product matches their expectations. Please note that all sales are final and the subscription amount is not refundable.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">Users are expected to be computer literate. They should know common terminologies and be conversant with general operations like Copy, Paste, Download, Run, etc.</p>

                <h2 class="mb-4">Scope of Support</h2>
                <p class="text-justify">Our support for charting platforms will be limited to bellglobal products on NinjaTrader integration. Charting platforms are vast and have many advanced features. Users are expected to learn them on their own from their platform providers or attend our courses.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">Our product installation and integration is straightforward – you have to simply click on the ‘NEXT’ button in most cases. Step-by-step Help Videos are also provided. Hence, we offer remote desktop support for product installation and integration generally only for the first time. We also show how to add symbols & apply the indicator. It is expected that users then follow the help videos to learn other things.</p>

                <h2 class="mb-4">Live Chat and Remote Support</h2>
                <p class="text-justify">While using live chat, users are expected to explain their issues in decent language. Abusive language over live chat will not be tolerated. Such users will be warned and may be denied support over live chat. No claim for any refunds will be entertained in such cases.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">Remote Desktop Support is the last resort and is generally used when there is no written help available to solve the issues reported by the users. Please do not expect us to show every feature of our products on remote desktop – it is simply not possible. It is expected that users follow the instructions as given in the user guide or by our executives to resolve the issues first – before requesting remote desktop support. We may reject offers for remote desktop support if asked for the same reasons again and again.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">That said, we wish to assure you that we offer remote desktop support willingly and pro-actively to resolve customer issues. This policy is laid out so as to prevent unnecessary excessive use – genuine issues are regularly handled and resolved using all support channels, including remote desktop support.</p>
